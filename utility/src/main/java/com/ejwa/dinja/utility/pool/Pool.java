/**
 * <p>Class that can be used to give an arbitrary object pooling capability. Whenever objects are created and garbage collected
 * very quickly (such as in a tight loop); pooling should be used. When objects are pooled, they are instead put in a list and
 * recycled whenever something needs a new instance of a particular class or object; this avoids the garbage collector from being
 * overloaded. The pooling class is used internally in Dinja Engine and can be used by projects that use the engine
 * whenever appropriate. Classes that should be poolable need to extend the {@link Poolable} interface and provide a proper
 * <code>clear()</code> method, which is called whenever an object is recycled with a {@link #allocateCleared()} call.</p>
 *
 * <p>It's very simple to create a thread-unique pool of objects of type <code>PooledType</code>. Making this kind of pool also
 * avoids having to deal with concurrency and synchronization between threads whenever multiple threads use objects from
 * the pool:</p>
 *
 * <blockquote><pre>
 * private static final ThreadLocal<Pool<PooledType>> POOL = new ThreadLocal<Pool<PooledType>>() {
 *	protected Pool<PooledType> initialValue() {
 *		return new Pool(PooledType.class);
 *	}
 * };</pre></blockquote>
 *
 * <p>It's then possible to call <code>POOL.get().{@link #allocate() allocate()}</code> and
 * <code>POOL.get().{@link #free(com.ejwa.dinja.utility.pool.Poolable) free()}</code> to fetch and store objects from and to the
 * pool.
