/**
 * Describes a heightmap geometry which actually is a {@link Plane} with vertices translated in the Z axis according to a
 * heightmap image.
 * <p>
 * The number of segments in a heightmap depends on the resolution of the heightmap image. For example, if a 64 * 64
 * heightmap image is used, the resulting <code>HeightMap</code> geometry will have 63 segments (64 * 64 = 4096) vertices.
 * <p>
 * Ideally, The image used as a heightmap should be a greyscale PNG image. A color image can also be used, but please note that
 * heightmap values will then only be fetched from the red channel of the image.
